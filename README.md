# lwdx
Lightweight document transformations. 
* LwDITA-based structured modular documentation in XML/XHTML/Markdown 
* Based on an emerging [OASIS standard](https://github.com/oasis-open/dita-lightweight) (although strict compliance is _not_ guaranteed) 
* Roundtrip conversions among all three formats for authoring-&-publishing freedom-&-flexibility 
* Straightforward XML mixed content handling 
* Avoids the horrors of Golang XML annotations 
## Contains 
* CLI commands
* API
## Features
* Relies on Golang `encoder/xml` package for parsing & tokenization
* Hides as much XML & DITA complexity as possible
* Can write out parse trees generated by [`xmlx`](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-pkg-xmlx), [`etree`](https://github.com/beevik/etree), [`mxj`](https://github.com/clbanning/mxj), [`x2j`](https://github.com/clbanning/mxj/tree/master/x2j), [Go `html`](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/html)
## License
* __LGPL 3.0__
* [Discussion (#1)](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/whitesource-blog/top-10-gpl-questions-answered/): <i><small>The LGPL and GPL licenses differ with one major exception; with LGPL the requirement that you open up the source code to your own extensions to the software is removed. You are only obliged to subject your modifications to the original free library to the LGPL. Since the free library is always subject to the LGPL, it must be possible for any user of your software to modify, recompile or replace the free LGPL library and use its modified version with your software.</small></i>
* [Discussion (#2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License): <i><small>The main difference between the GPL and the LGPL is that the latter allows the work to be linked with (in the case of a library, "used by") a  non-(L)GPLed program, regardless of whether it is free software or proprietary software. The non-(L)GPLed program can then be distributed under any terms if it is not a derivative work.</small></i>
* (Future:TBS) Dual licensing to provide an option for unencumbered commercial use 
## Missing
* Tests =:-O 
* XML entity substitutions (but didn't you get the memo? you're sposta use DITA `conref`)
* Details of comment handlng in Markdown (note that LwDITA uses CommonMark with extensions) 
## Roadmap 
* A schema-driven WYSIWYG IBE (in-browser editor, probably based on [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/demo/xmlcomplete.html)) 
* Integration with DITA for Small Teams [D4ST](http://www.dita-for-small-teams.org/)
